In this paper, we explore the possibilities of increasing the robustness, reliability and most importantly, accuracy, of neural networks when applied to areas with limited data. Nowadays, to introduce variations in image datasets, simple flip- ping and rotating of images is done. However, we wanted to go beyond that and find out whether augmenting the dataset by generating new images can improve the accuracy of a face recognition model after re-training. We use a state of the art face recognition model and two data augmentation methods to augment a limited sub-sampled dataset. We discuss their effectiveness and how they can be used to solve the problem of algorithm reliability and limited data.
